# Resume-Website
PAUSED - due to ongoing semester<br/>
My first website<br/>
Implementing the basics of HTML, JS, CSS and learning new things!<br/>
When I started working on this website, the first thing which caught my attention was that the document elements didn't automatically fit on different resolutions.<br/>
Thus, I started learning more and more in a very fun process and got familiar with:
- The use of BootStrap 5.
- Parallax scrolling.
- Dove deeper in understanding CSS animations.
- Different uses for event listeners.
- And much more!
