## Installation

The website doesn't need a specific installation procedure as it's a simple static site. You just need to clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/SamerArkab/personal-website.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository folder:
    ```
    cd personal-website
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

The website is divided into several sections, each dedicated to a specific purpose. You can navigate between the different sections using the navigation bar at the top.

- Introduction: A brief overview about me and my professional background.
- Projects: This section showcases some of my previous projects with brief descriptions and links to the respective GitHub repositories for more detailed information.
- Contact Information: This section contains my contact information, including my email and LinkedIn profile, and offers the ability to download my CV.

## Features

- Scroll-Spy: The website uses Bootstrap's Scrollspy feature to highlight the navigation links based on the scroll position.
- Animation: The website features various animations that are triggered based on the user's interaction or scroll position. These animations are implemented using CSS and JavaScript.
- Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive and adapts its layout based on the viewport size.

The JavaScript code for this website is organized as follows:

- Global variables are declared at the beginning for elements that are interacted with in the script.
- Event listeners are added to various elements to trigger specific behaviors based on user interactions or window events.
- Clicking on the question mark triggers a rotation animation for a mushroom image and changes its position. Mouseover and mouseleave events on the question mark also trigger different visual effects.
- A scroll event listener is used to dynamically update the animation properties of the Mario image and other elements based on the scroll position.
- The website features a 'back-to-top' button that appears when the user scrolls down. Clicking on it brings the user back to the top of the page.
